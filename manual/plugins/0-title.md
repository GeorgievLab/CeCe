# Plugins
List of available plugins supplied within official distribution. Depending on how the simulator is built,
some plugins can be builtin and rest of them can be extern as shared libraries (`dll` / `dynlib` / `so`).

> Some of them may not be available on your platform, so check the list by calling application with `--plugins` flag.
