After some time a new version is finally done. Most changes are done in background (core, plugins and apps separation). There are some new plugins: `cytometry`, `fluorescence`, `object-streamlines-generator` and`diffusion-streamlines-python`.

The new version binaries can be from [download page]({{ site.url }}/download/) or [github releases](https://github.com/GeorgievLab/CeCe/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

So enjoy the new version.
